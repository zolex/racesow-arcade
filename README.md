## Game Mechanics

### Run

run and gain some speed. when slow, running speeds you up. when faster, it slows you down.

`press right (D)?`

### Jump

Jump to gain and maintain speed.

`press (SPACE)` 

the closer you are to the ground when jumping, the faster you accelerate. it shows ACC for the last jump on the top. also it shows if you jumped too early or too late to get a sense of perfect timing). you can also early press and hold jump to safely maintain your speed.

`press right (D)` while jumping will help you to not lose speed when jumping to late, but it has less acceleration

(press right while jumping to be safe. don't press it for maximum acceleration while taking the risk to lose speed if your timing isn't good!)

### Wall Jump

allows crossing larger gaps or gaining upwards speed when [plasma-climbing](#Plasma-Climb)

`press left ALT`

### Air Control

allows moving while in the air. helpful to climb edges or avoid hitting an obstacle

`press left (A) or right (D)` while mid-air

### Crouch

slowly move under obstacles

`press down (S)` 

### Crouch-Slide

to slide under objects without losing too much speed

`press down (S) + right (A)` 

### Ramp-slide

sliding up or down a ramp is faster than running and jumping over ramps

`press down (S) + right (A)` when on a ramp

### Plasma-Climb

climb up a wall by using the plasma gun.

`press down (S) and shoot (RETURN)` when in front of a wall 

*note that it is the direction you are shooting at, so shooting down moves you up*

### Plasma-Slide

while plasma-climbing, you can gain speed by shooting left or right 

`press left (A) or right (D)` while plasma climbing

*note that it is the direction you are shooting at, so shooting left moves you right and vice versa*

### Rocket-Jump

shooting a rocket under your feed while jumping lets you jump higher.

`press down (S) and shoot (RETURN)` while on the ground

### Double Rocket-Jump

when falling, you can shoot the first rocket and then overtake it while falling, so that you have the time to shoot a second rocket and jump even higher.

`press down (S) and shoot (RETURN)` while falling, land on the ground and time the second rocket
`press down (S) and shoot (RETURN)` again to have two simultaneous explosions

*note that the exact position of the explosions will affect how you are boosted. e.g. having the first rocket explode a little behind you and the second directly under you, will boost you more forwards and not just straight upwards*
